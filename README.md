A Python ML project that detects credit card fraud across 50,000 synthetic transactions using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Handles class imbalance via oversampling, engineers risk features, and outputs a 9-panel analysis chart. Flags individual transactions with a fraud probability score and confidence level.
